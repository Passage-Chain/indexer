# Passage Indexer

Passage Indexer is a powerful and efficient blockchain data processing solution designed specifically for the Passage Marketplace ecosystem. This monorepo houses two main components: a high-performance blockchain indexer and a flexible API for querying the indexed data.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Indexing**: Captures and processes all relevant data from Passage Marketplace smart contracts.
- **Real-time Data Access**: Provides up-to-date information through a dedicated API.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built as a monorepo for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Utilizes PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for optimized data management.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Includes detailed setup instructions and Docker support for quick deployment.

Whether you're building dApps, conducting market analysis, or integrating Passage Marketplace data into your projects, Passage Indexer offers a robust foundation for accessing and utilizing blockchain data efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Create a postgresql database
4. Set up environment variables (see `.env.sample` files in each app)
5. Build the project:
   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```

- `apps/indexer`: The main indexer application
- `apps/api`: API for querying indexed data
- `packages/database`: Shared database package using Drizzle ORM

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Drizzle ORM
- Turbo
- Docker
- Webpack

## Indexer

The indexer is the core application of this project. It processes blockchain data and stores it in a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

Key features:
- Indexes blockchain data efficiently
- Uses a caching mechanism for block data
- Supports multiple message types
- Handles validator information

## API

The API provides access to the indexed data stored in the PostgreSQL database. It's built using Hono, a lightweight web framework for Node.js.

## Database

The shared database package uses Drizzle ORM for database operations. It includes schema definitions and utility functions for database interactions.

## Docker

The project includes Docker configurations for both the indexer and API. To build Docker images:

```
pnpm run dc:build
```

## Development

This project uses Turbo for managing the monorepo. Common commands:

- `pnpm run dev`: Run all applications in development mode
- `pnpm run build`: Build all applications
- `pnpm run lint`: Lint all applications
- `pnpm run db:check`: Check database schema
- `pnpm run db:generate`: Generate database migrations
